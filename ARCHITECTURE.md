# Calculator Application - Modular Architecture

## Overview
The calculator application has been successfully refactored into a modular architecture for better organization, maintainability, and scalability.

## Project Structure

### 📁 Controllers/
- **CalculatorController.cs**: Main application controller that orchestrates the flow between UI, operations, and services.

### 📁 Operations/
- **BasicOperations.cs**: Contains fundamental arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- **AdvancedOperations.cs**: Contains advanced mathematical operations (square root, exponentiation, average calculation)
- **CompositeOperations.cs**: Contains operations that combine multiple basic operations (e.g., applying all four operations)

### 📁 Services/
- **HistoryManager.cs**: Manages calculation history including storage, retrieval, saving to file, and loading from file

### 📁 UI/
- **UIManager.cs**: Handles all user interface operations including menu display, input collection, result display, and console formatting

### 📁 Utils/
- **InputValidator.cs**: Centralized input validation utilities providing robust parsing, range validation, and error handling for all user inputs

### 📁 Root/
- **Program.cs**: Simple entry point that creates and runs the calculator controller

## Key Benefits of This Architecture

### 🔧 **Separation of Concerns**
- Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility
- UI logic is separated from business logic
- Data management is isolated in dedicated services

### 📈 **Scalability**
- Easy to add new operations by extending existing operation classes
- New UI components can be added without affecting business logic
- Additional services (logging, configuration, etc.) can be integrated easily

### 🧪 **Testability**
- Each module can be unit tested independently
- Dependencies are clearly defined and can be easily mocked
- Business logic is isolated from UI and file operations

### 🔄 **Maintainability**
- Code is organized in logical modules
- Changes to one module don't affect others
- Easy to locate and modify specific functionality

### 🎨 **Enhanced User Experience**
- Colored console output for better readability
- Clear menu structure and prompts
- Proper error handling and messaging
- Pause functionality for better flow control

## Usage Examples

### Adding New Operations
To add a new operation:
1. Add the method to the appropriate operations class (Basic/Advanced/Composite)
2. Add a menu option in UIManager
3. Add a handler method in CalculatorController

### Extending History Features
The HistoryManager can be extended to:
- Support different file formats (JSON, XML)
- Add filtering and search capabilities
- Implement history size limits

### UI Enhancements
The UIManager can be enhanced with:
- More color schemes
- Better input validation
- Progress indicators for complex operations

## Dependencies
- .NET 8.0
- System.IO for file operations
- System.Collections.Generic for history management

## Running the Application
```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

The application maintains all original functionality while providing a much cleaner, more maintainable codebase structure.
