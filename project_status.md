# Suggestions for Improving the Calculator

- [x] Add more mathematical functions: exponentiation, square root
- [ ] Add more mathematical functions: modulus, trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithms
- [x] Input validation & error handling: use TryParse for all number inputs, handle exceptions gracefully, provide user-friendly error messages
- [x] History feature: store and display a history of calculations performed during the session
- [X] Support for multiple numbers: allow operations (like sum, average, etc.) on a list of numbers, not just two or three
- [X] User interface improvements: add color to the console output, use clearer menus and prompts
- [X] Modularize the code: move each operation into its own class or file for better organization and scalability
- [x] Save/load functionality: allow users to save their calculation history to a file and load it later
- [x] Unit tests: add a test project to ensure all operations work as expected
- [X] Scientific/programmer modes: add modes for scientific or programmer calculations (binary, hex, bitwise operations)
- [x] GUI version: create a simple graphical user interface using Windows Forms or WPF

## Current Warnings

The build error has been fixed, but there are still multiple compiler warnings. Next steps:

- [ ] Review and resolve all compiler warnings for cleaner builds and better code quality.
    - Run `dotnet build` to see the list of warnings.
    - Address each warning, prioritizing those related to potential bugs or deprecated features.

## Next Steps

- Add input validation and error handling for all user inputs.
- Expand the set of mathematical operations (modulus, trigonometric, logarithmic, etc.).
- Allow operations on multiple numbers (not just two or three).
- Refactor code for modularity and maintainability.
- Add unit tests for all operations.
- Enhance the user interface (console or GUI).
- Add scientific/programmer modes.
